2. Extract the zip archive to any folder.
3. Open Google Chrome browser.
4. Type <a target="_blank" href="chrome://extensions">chrome://extensions</a> in the address bar and press Enter.
5. Enable the Developer Mode located in the top right corner of the page.
6. Find the option "Load unpacked" and click on it.

## Steps to set up the bot
2. Create a Telegram bot following the instructions provided by <a target="_blank" href="https://t.me/BotFather">@BotFather</a>.
3. Add the created bot to your Telegram channel and grant it permission to post messages.


Steps to configure the extension in your browser:
1. Copy the API key provided by <a target="_blank" href="https://t.me/BotFather">@BotFather</a> and paste it into the "Token Key" field in the extension settings.
2. In the "Chat ID" field, specify the public name of your channel in the format @channelName.
   - If your channel is private, instead of the public name, you need to provide the unique identifier of your channel.
     To obtain the unique identifier, follow these steps:
     - Temporarily make your channel public.
     - Go to the following link: `https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_TOKEN_KEY>/getChat?chat_id=@channelName`
       Replace <YOUR_TOKEN_KEY> with your API key, and replace @channelName with the name of your channel.
     - Copy the negative number from the "id" field in the API response and paste it into the "Chat ID" field in the extension settings.
     - After configuring the extension, you can revert your channel back to private mode.

It is **recommended** to always use the unique identifier (Chat ID) as the bot will continue to work even if you switch your channel to private mode.
