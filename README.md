## Browser Extension Installation
1. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Octoober/anime-art-forwarder/releases">Download the zip archive</a> of the extension to your computer.
2. Extract the zip archive to any folder.
3. Open Google Chrome browser.
4. Type `chrome://extensions` in the address bar and press Enter.
5. Enable the Developer Mode located in the top right corner of the page.
6. Find the option "Load unpacked" and click on it.
7. Choose the folder where you extracted the archive.
## Steps to set up the bot
2. Create a Telegram bot following the instructions provided by <a target="_blank" href="https://t.me/BotFather">@BotFather</a>.
3. Add the created bot to your Telegram channel and grant it permission to post messages.


### Steps to configure the extension in your browser:
1. Copy the API key provided by <a target="_blank" href="https://t.me/BotFather">@BotFather</a> and paste it into the "Token Key" field in the extension settings.
2. In the "Chat ID" field, specify the public name of your channel in the format **@channelName**.
   - **If your channel is private**, instead of the public name, you need to provide the unique identifier of your channel.
     To obtain the unique identifier, follow these steps:
     - Temporarily make your channel public.
     - Go to the following link: `https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_TOKEN_KEY>/getChat?chat_id=@channelName`
       Replace **<YOUR_TOKEN_KEY>** with your API key, and replace **@channelName** with the name of your channel.
     - Copy the negative number from the "id" field in the API response and paste it into the "Chat ID" field in the extension settings.
     - After configuring the extension, you can revert your channel back to private mode.

It is **recommended** to always use the unique identifier (Chat ID) as the bot will continue to work even if you switch your channel to private mode.
